<h1>Great Basin Fiber Arts Fair</h1>
<div
	<p>Every year, near the end of the summer, we gather to the South Jordan Equestrian Park to peddle our wares, demo spinning, knitting, weaving, and other fiber arts.</p>
	<p>The Great Basin Fiber Arts Fair is a non-profit pending organization that promotes fiber arts as historical and thriving art forms. We want to share our love of fiber arts with the our community.</p>
	<p>Our friends from the fiber community will join us to demo and teach classes. We will have samples of knit, spinning, crochet, felting, weaving and other fiber related arts forms.</p>
	<p>We will also have many vendors that help you get started with the equipment and materials you will need, once you catch the fiber arts bug!</p>
	<p>Animals, fiber, crafts, education and family fun all blended together. Join us for shopping, demonstrations, competitions, and much more!</p>
	<p>Come and join us!!</p>
