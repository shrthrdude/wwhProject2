<h1>Park City Utah Retreat</h1>
<h3>At Bob and Kathy Wright's Meadow</h3>
<div>
	<p><strong>For Guild members only:</strong> We bring our tents, sleeping bags, wheels, chairs, PRIZES to share and rekindle old friendships.</p>
	<p>There is a cost to attend this event but the cost covers porta-potties and meals.  And boy, do we eat well, even steaks on Saturday Night!  We assist with the cooking and other chores to help out.</p>
	<p>We have a Retreat exchange show & tell on Saturday.  In secret, we exchange fiber to spin and turn into something lovely to be given back to the fiber owner the next year.</p>
	<p>Donâ€™t worry about running out of fiber, there will be plenty to purchase from our members with fiber businesses.</p>
	<p>Past retreats we have celebrated the memory of Kathy by hanging crystals on the trees in the meadow.  We lost Bob in 2010 and miss having him join us in the meadow.</p>
	<p>Camping, eating, laughing, spinning, PRIZES, mini-classes, more laughing, PRIZES.</p>
	<p>No phones, no kids, no computers, just peaceful spinning and memory making, oh, did I mention PRIZES, and memories.</p>
