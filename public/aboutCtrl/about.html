<h1>About Us</h1>
<div>
	<p>Why do we spin, when we can just buy yarn?</p>
	<p>Everyone has their own answer for this...connection to an art form practiced by our ancestors... the ability to create the type of yarn you want... the therapeutic rhythm of spinning… the pleasure of working with exotic fibers</p>
	<p>Our guild is a great way to experience all of these points of view.  You will find opportunities to learn and grow in this art form that is still thriving today.  You will be a part of an amazing community that spans the world, and meet the people who live in your own community.</p>
	<p id="bold">We meet every 3rd Wednesday of the month at the Thimbles and Threads, 12215 South 900 East, Draper, UT 84020.</p>
	<p>We sponsor retreats, study groups, spinning Saturdays, and workshops.  We demonstrate at fairs and other locations around Utah.  The first Saturday in May is the Notlwonk Wool Trek in Cache County, Utah.  This event is filled with fun, food, sheep and the run for “skirts”.</p>
	<p>Our officers are made up entirely of volunteers, and our Guild is pending its non-profit status.  We encourage our members to volunteer in their communities when given the opportunity.</p>
	<p>We share our skills, experiences and friendship and are always willing to encourage fellow members in adding to their stash…(tee hee).  Some of our members running their own fiber businesses. so there isn’t any lack of resources for supplies.  We encourage support of local businesses to keep resource close to home.</p>
