<h1>Project List and Annual Events</h1>
<div class="project">
	<p>Every year the Guild President chooses a color or theme for our Annual Dye Exchange plus she will give us a challenge for the year.</p>
	<p>This year’s Theme is: <strong>Flowers In My Garden.</strong>  The Dye Exchange will be at the Guild meeting in March 18, 2015.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="projTitle">The Annual Spin Challenge</h2>
<div class="project">
	There will only be 20 bags available to purchase for the challenge.<br>
	If you would like to participate, it will be $5.00. You will want to participate in the fiber challenge this year because we are trying out new cool fiber!<br>
	The challenge will begin at the October 15th meeting.
</div>
<h2 class="projTitle">The Annual Dye Exchange</h2>
<div class="project">
	The basic idea is to use the President’s color choice and dye 32 ounces of fiber to share with guild members.  The president will announce her color choice during our September Meeting. Then at our meeting in March 2015, you get to share your fiber with everyone, in one ounce portions, and tell us why you picked those colors.  The date of the exchange will be provided by the President, (usually Feb or Mar).<br>
	We suggest you bring at least 32 ounces of dyed fiber.  The fibers are to be pulled apart (Never Cut) into 1 ounce bundles, labeled with your name and description of dye method and materials used.<br>
	This year’s Theme is: Flowers In My Garden.  The Dye Exchange will be at the Guild meeting in March 18, 2015.<br>
	As you can see by the photo above you will return home with a wonderful variety of samples to spin plus great ideas for you to re-create at home if you wish.  It’s just like fiber trick-or-treat, only it’s always a treat!<br><br>
