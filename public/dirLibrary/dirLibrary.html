	<h5>At the Home of Julie Davies.</h5>
	<h3>Memories of Riki Darling</h3>
	<p>Riki was one of the founding members of Wasatch Woolpack Handspinners and championed the formation and penning of our Bylaws.  She was an adventurous knitter, a spinner and weaver of Navajo type rugs.  She also taught others how to do anything that she knew how to do. </p>
	<p>The following pictures show an afghan that members and friends knitted/crocheted/wove for her to show our love for her when she was fighting a battle for her life. </p>

	<script type="text/javascript">
		var slideimagesRiki = new Array()
		slideimagesRiki[0] = "images/rikiparty.png"
		slideimagesRiki[1] = "images/quilt1.png"
		slideimagesRiki[2] = "images/quilt2.png"
		slideimagesRiki[3] = "images/quilt3.png" 


		//variable that will increment through the images
		var stepRiki = 0

		function slideit2(){
		 //if browser does not support the image object, exit.
			if (!document.images){
				return
			}
		//this is where the image gets swapped
			var imgRiki = document.getElementById('slide2');
			imgRiki.src = slideimagesRiki[stepRiki];
			if (stepRiki<slideimagesRiki.length - 1) {
				stepRiki++
			} else {
				stepRiki=0
			}
		 //call function "slideit()" every 3 seconds
			setTimeout("slideit2()",3000)
